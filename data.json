      "Whoever will be free must make himself free. Freedom is no fairy gift to fall into a man's lap. What is freedom? To have the will to be responsible for one's self.",
      "The State has always one purpose: to limit, control, subordinate the individual and subject him to the general purpose Through its censorship, its supervision, and its police the State tries to obstruct all free activity and sees this repression as its duty, because the instinct of self-preservation demands it. The State does not permit me to use my thoughts to their full value and communicate them to other men unless they are its own Otherwise it shuts me up.",
      "The State calls its own violence, law; but that of the individual, crime.",
      "Whoever is a complete person does not need to be an authority.",
      "Freedom cannot be granted. It must be taken.",
      "When every one is to cultivate himself into man, condemning a man to machine-like labor amounts to the same thing as slavery. If a factory-worker must tire himself to death twelve hours and more, he is cut off from becoming man. Every labor is to have the intent that the man be satisfied.... His labor is nothing taken by itself, has no object in itself, is nothing complete in itself; he labors only into another's hands, and is used (exploited) by this other.",
      "The habit of the religious way of thinking has biased our mind so grievously that we are - terrified at ourselves in our nakedness and naturalness; it has degraded us so that we deem ourselves depraved by nature, born devils."

   "Albert Camus":[
      "Life is meaningless, but worth living, provided you recognize it's meaningless.",
      "The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.",
      "Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend"
